Our protocol solves critical challenges in the current compute resource market, including price volatility, lack of standardization, verification difficulties, and trust issues. STAB3L's approach combines advanced zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), trusted execution environments (TEEs), and a dual-token economic model to create a paradigm shift in how compute resources are priced, allocated, and utilized.

With a total addressable market projected to reach $1T by 2030 and an experienced team from leading technology and blockchain companies, STAB3L is positioned to become the foundation for the future of stable, decentralized compute infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

{% accordion title="The Compute Resource Market Challenges" %}
The compute resource market faces several critical challenges that STAB3L addresses:

1. **Price Volatility**: Compute costs fluctuate by Â±30% annually, creating unpredictable expenses for AI developers, blockchain projects, and scientific research.

2. **Lack of Standardization**: No universal standard exists for measuring and comparing compute resources, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions.

3. **Verification Challenges**: Users struggle to verify the actual capabilities of compute resources, leading to mistrust and inefficient resource allocation.

4. **Trust Issues**: The market relies heavily on centralized intermediaries for verification and settlement, introducing single points of failure and trust concerns.
{% endaccordion %}

These challenges create significant friction in the market, limiting growth and innovation in the broader blockchain and AI ecosystems.

## The STAB3L Solution

STAB3L addresses these challenges through a comprehensive compute-backed stablecoin protocol with three key components:

### 1. Compute Unit Standardization & Verification

STAB3L introduces a standardized Compute Unit (CU) representing a quantifiable measure of computational power. The standardization process involves benchmarking raw compute resources, applying our proprietary standardization algorithm, and assigning CU values.

The mathematical foundation of our CU standardization is expressed as:

$$
CU = \alpha \cdot \text{FLOPS} + \beta \cdot \text{MEM} + \gamma \cdot \text{STORAGE} + \delta \cdot \text{NETWORK}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are weighting coefficients
- FLOPS = Floating Point Operations Per Second (1 CU = 10^15 FLOPs)
- MEM = Memory bandwidth and capacity
- STORAGE = Storage capacity and I/O performance
- NETWORK = Network throughput and latency

{% hint style="info" %}
The value of 1 CU is $0.06 at launch. This definition will be reviewed and potentially adjusted quarterly by the DAO through governance voting to ensure the CU standard remains relevant as compute technology evolves.
{% endhint %}

<div id="standardization-process-chart" 
  data-chart-type="bar"
  data-chart-labels='["Raw Compute", "Benchmarking", "Verification", "Standardization", "CU Assignment", "Token Creation", "Lock Period", "Exchange for sSTB", "CU Burning"]'
  data-chart-datasets='[
    {
      "label": "Process Flow",
      "data": [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20],
      "backgroundColor": "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.7)",
      "borderColor": "rgb(54, 162, 235)",
      "borderWidth": 1
    }
  ]'
  data-chart-options='{
    "responsive": true,
    "maintainAspectRatio": false,
    "plugins": {
      "title": {
        "display": true,
        "text": "Compute Unit Standardization Process",
        "font": {
          "size": 16,
          "weight": "bold"
        }
      },
      "legend": {
        "position": "top"
      }
    }
  }'
  style="height: 400px; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0; border: 1px dashed #ccc; border-radius: 5px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666;">Chart loading...</p>
</div>

Verification is ensured through either Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), providing cryptographic guarantees of compute resource capabilities without revealing sensitive hardware details.

### 2. Dual-Token System

STAB3L implements a dual-token system that separates utility and governance functions:

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">sSTB Token (sSTB)</h3>
    <p>The stablecoin pegged to 1 CU</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 10 billion tokens</p>
    <p><strong>Value:</strong> Always $0.06 per token (1 CU)</p>
    <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Stable compute pricing, fee payments, staking, liquidity provision</p>
  </div>
  <div class="border rounded-lg p-4 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">STB Governance Token (rSTB)</h3>
    <p>The governance and rewards token</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 1 billion tokens</p>
    <p><strong>Value:</strong> Market-determined, appreciates with protocol growth</p>
    <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Governance voting, staking rewards, fee discounts</p>
  </div>
</div>

### 3. Compute-Backed Stablecoin Mechanism

The core of STAB3L is the compute-backed stablecoin mechanism:

1. **Compute Provider Staking**: Providers stake their compute resources for a period of their choosing (minimum 7 days), which are verified and standardized into CUs.
2. **Temporary CU Token Creation**: Verified compute resources are represented as temporary CU tokens.
3. **Immediate Exchange and Burning**: CU tokens are immediately exchanged for sSTB and burned in the process.
4. **Automatic sSTB Staking**: The newly minted sSTB tokens are automatically staked for the period chosen by the provider.
5. **rSTB Rewards**: Providers earn rSTB rewards throughout the staking period, with longer staking periods earning higher rewards.
6. **sSTB Redemption**: Users can redeem sSTB for actual compute resources at the stable price of $0.06 per CU.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: CU tokens are NOT tradable assets. They are temporary tokens that are burned immediately when exchanged for sSTB. This burning mechanism is crucial for maintaining the peg and ensuring that each sSTB is backed by real compute resources.
{% endhint %}

### Provider Staking

Compute providers stake their resources with the following parameters:

- **Minimum Staking Period**: 7 days
- **Collateralization Requirement**: Minimum 120% of CU value
- **Reward Structure**: Longer staking periods earn progressively higher rSTB rewards
- **Staking Process**: Compute resources are verified, CU tokens are issued and immediately burned, sSTB is minted and automatically staked

## Technical Architecture

STAB3L employs a modular, layered architecture designed for security, scalability, and interoperability:

## Token Economics

STAB3L's dual-token system creates a balanced economic model with clear value accrual mechanisms:

### Token Distribution

    }
  }'

</div>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="sSTB Distribution" %}
| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|
| Community & Ecosystem | 40% | 4 billion | 4-year linear vesting |
| Treasury | 25% | 2.5 billion | Controlled by governance |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 1.5 billion | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear vesting |
| Investors | 15% | 1.5 billion | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear vesting |
| Liquidity Mining | 5% | 0.5 billion | Released over 4 years |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="rSTB Distribution" %}
| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|
| Community | 40% | 400 million | Released through staking rewards |
| Team | 20% | 200 million | 1-year cliff, 4-year linear vesting |
| Treasury | 20% | 200 million | Controlled by governance |
| Investors | 15% | 150 million | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear vesting |
| Advisors | 5% | 50 million | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear vesting |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

Both tokens include deflationary mechanisms and value accrual:

- **sSTB**: Value is maintained through the 1:1 peg to CUs, with each token always worth $0.06 (1 CU). 10% of all fees collected in sSTB are burned, creating deflationary pressure.

- **rSTB**: Value appreciates through:
  - 20% of protocol fees allocated to buy back and burn rSTB
  - Governance rights over a growing protocol
  - Staking rewards and fee discounts
  - Reduced supply through burning mechanisms (5% of all rewards distributed are burned)

### Staking Programs

Multiple staking programs drive token utility with the following expected yields:

## Conclusion

STAB3L represents a paradigm shift in how compute resources are priced, allocated, and utilized. By creating the world's first compute-backed stablecoin protocol, we're addressing the critical challenge of price volatility in the compute market while providing a stable, efficient ecosystem for all participants.

Our dual-token system (sSTB and rSTB) creates a balanced economic model that separates utility and governance functions, with clear value accrual mechanisms for both tokens. The compute-backed stablecoin mechanism, where CU tokens are burned when exchanged for sSTB, ensures that each sSTB is backed by real compute resources and maintains its peg to 1 CU ($0.06).

With a dedicated team, comprehensive roadmap, and growing market demand, STAB3L is positioned to become the foundation for the future of stable, decentralized compute infrastructure.
